# Contributing: Adding a New PostgreSQL Extension

This guide walks you through the lifecycle of adding a new extension, from
setting up your environment to submitting a Pull Request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure you have also read the general
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/governance/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
> for CloudNativePG before proceeding.

## 1. Phase One: Fork, Clone, and Validate

Before proposing a change, ensure your local machine is compatible with the
[build stack](BUILD.md).

1. **Fork** the [cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers)
   repository.
2. **Clone** your fork and enter the directory:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/postgres-extensions-containers.git
    cd postgres-extensions-containers
    ```
3. **Verify the Environment:** Run the following to ensure you can build the
   existing project ecosystem.
    ```sh
    task prereqs      # Check if Go, Task, and Docker are ready
    task checks:all   # Validate current configurations
    task bake:all     # Optional: build all existing extensions to confirm the Dagger engine
    ```

## 2. Phase Two: The Proposal & Package Discovery

To maintain high standards and avoid duplicated effort or architectural
conflicts, every new extension begins with a formal proposal.
During this phase, you must verify that the extension is available as a
Debian package in the `main` component (which by definition complies with
the [Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)](https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines)),
from a trusted, auditable repository, and identify its versioning logic. The PGDG (PostgreSQL Global Development Group) repository is the
recommended source; other Debian repositories are acceptable provided they meet
the same standards.

### Identifying the Package & Version

You must verify the package across both the current Debian `stable` and
`oldstable` distributions to ensure compatibility. Use a temporary container to
search the repositories:

For Debian `stable` (13, `trixie`):

```sh
docker run -u root -ti --rm ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie
```

For Debian `oldstable` (12, `bookworm`):

```sh
docker run -u root -ti --rm ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-bookworm
```

Then, inside the container:

```sh
apt update && apt search <EXTENSION_NAME>
```

#### Understanding the Version String

Take note of both the **package name** and the **version string**.
Using `pgvector` as an example, you will notice that while the package name
remains constant, the versioning reflects the underlying Debian release:

- `trixie`: `0.8.2-1.pgdg13+1`
- `bookworm`: `0.8.2-1.pgdg12+1`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `pgdg13` or `pgdg12` suffix is critical. Correctly identifying this
> versioning pattern ensures that `renovate` can automatically monitor the
> upstream repositories and trigger update Pull Requests once your extension is
> merged.

#### Inspecting the Package Content

If you want to get a list of the files contained in the package, you need to
first install the extension in the disposable container:

```sh
apt install <package-name>
```

Then, list the content of the package with:

```sh
dpkg -L <full-package-name>
```

Confirm that `.control` and `.sql` files are present in the expected PostgreSQL
paths.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the package doesn't contain any `.control` file, it is likely to be a
> **PostgreSQL module** rather than an extension. In this case, remember to set
> the `create_extension` option to `false` in your `metadata.hcl` file.

### Opening an Issue

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Community Commitment:** By opening the issue, you are confirming your
> intent to help maintain this extension on behalf of the CloudNativePG
> community.

After gathering the package details and verifying the extension's license,
submit your proposal:

1. Point your browser to ["New Extension Proposal"](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers/issues/new/choose).
2. Provide the package name, versioning info, and a link to the upstream source.
3. State the license clearly. Every component in the extension image must be
   covered by a license on the
   [CNCF Allowlist](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/policies-guidance/allowed-third-party-license-policy.md)
   (e.g., Apache-2.0, MIT, PostgreSQL License). CNCF policy requires a formal
   exception for any component not covered by the Allowlist; the maintainers
   do not intend to file exception requests for new extensions, so only
   Allowlisted components will be accepted. This is a governance decision,
   not a legal limitation; contributors whose extension cannot meet this
   requirement are welcome to adopt the same build tooling and distribute
   images independently.

> [!NOTE]
> In most cases you may begin development before receiving maintainer
> approval. However, if a fundamental problem (e.g., a non-Allowlisted
> license) is discovered during the proposal review, your work will not be
> mergeable. Verify license compliance before investing significant
> development effort.

## 3. Phase Three: Implementation & Scaffolding

### Creating a Branch

```sh
git checkout -b dev/<extension-name>
```

### Scaffolding

Generate the directory structure automatically:

```sh
task create-extension NAME=<extension-name>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For advanced scaffolding (custom distros or versions), see
> [`BUILD.md`](./BUILD.md#advanced-scaffolding).

### Customizing the Files

The scaffolding generates `metadata.hcl`, `Dockerfile`, and `README.md`.
Follow the specific instructions and "TODO" comments found within each
generated file to finalize your extension.

#### Package Version vs. SQL Version

Your `metadata.hcl` file requires two version fields:

- **`package`**: The full Debian package version (e.g., `0.8.2-1.pgdg13+1`).
  This includes packaging metadata and is used to install the correct package.

- **`sql`**: The PostgreSQL extension version as it appears in the catalog
  (e.g., `0.8.2`). This is the version of the extension that will be verified
  as part of the automatic testing of the resulting containers. It should
  match what is defined by the `default_version` field in the control file.


> [!WARNING]
> The `sql` version is optional and only needed if your extension uses
> `CREATE EXTENSION` (when `create_extension = true` in metadata).

> [!TIP]
> Pay close attention to the `// renovate:` comments in the metadata and
> `README.md` files; these are required for automated version tracking.

## 4. Phase Four: Local Testing & Validation

Testing is the most critical part of the lifecycle.

### Automated E2E Testing

> [!NOTE]
> For a detailed breakdown of the testing infrastructure, refer to
> [`BUILD.md`](./BUILD.md#local-testing-guide).

The repository provides a framework for full End-to-End validation. Ensure that
the entire pipeline is working:

```sh
task checks:all
```

Then run the full E2E tests for the extension. This task will build your image,
push it to a local registry, spin up a Kind cluster, and run the functional
tests:

```sh
task e2e:test:full TARGET="<extension-name>"
```

### Local Manual Verification

Once the automated tests have run, the Kind cluster remains active. You can
"drop in" to this environment to verify the instructions you wrote in your
`README.md`.

#### Exporting the Kubeconfig

```sh
task e2e:export-kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_PATH=./kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
```

#### Identifying the Image Tag

Once the image is built and pushed to the local registry (`localhost:5000`),
you should verify the generated tags. You can use tools like `skopeo` to
inspect the local registry:

```bash
skopeo list-tags --tls-verify=false docker://localhost:5000/<extension-name>-testing
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to add the `-testing` suffix to the container registry.

Verify that the output lists tags for all expected PostgreSQL and Debian
version combinations.

#### Testing the Extension

Create a `Cluster` resource using the instructions from your `README.md`.
Pay close attention to the image location. Inside the Kubernetes cluster, the
local registry is reachable at `registry.pg-extensions:5000`:

```yaml
image: registry.pg-extensions:5000/<extension-name>-testing:<tag>
```

### Extending Tests

While the framework provides a generic smoke test, we highly encourage you to
add **extension-specific tests**. Review the [`postgis`](./postgis) directory
for an example of additional testing using the Chainsaw framework.

### Cleaning up

Once you have finished your manual verification, tear down the test
environment:

```bash
task e2e:cleanup
```

## 5. Phase Five: Documentation & The Pull Request

### The `README.md` file

The `README.md` is typically the last file you complete. A clear, professional
`README.md` makes an extension successful. Ensure it includes YAML examples for
`Cluster` and `Database` resources so users can immediately adopt your work.

### Commit and Submit

Once you have verified your extension locally and are satisfied with the
results, it is time to submit your contribution.

To maintain a clean and searchable history, we require a specific commit
format. If you have multiple experimental commits on your branch, please squash
them into a single commit before submitting.

Format:

```text
feat: add `<extension-name>` container image

<DESCRIPTION: Explain what the extension does and why it's being added.>

Closes #<issue-id>
```

Submission Requirements:

- **DCO Compliance**: All commits must be signed (`git commit -s`) to certify
  that you have the right to submit the code under the project's license.
- **Upstream Target**: Ensure your Pull Request is targeting the `main` branch of
  the upstream repository.
- **CODEOWNERS**: The PR must add an entry to the [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS)
  file listing the GitHub handles of the component owner(s) for the new
  extension folder.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When opening the Pull Request, use the **new extension** template, which
> includes the full contributor checklist for this lifecycle. GitHub does not
> show a chooser for PR templates, so open the PR with this link to preselect
> it:
> [Open a new-extension PR](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/postgres-extensions-containers/compare?expand=1&template=new_extension.md).
> For any other change (version bumps, fixes, tooling, docs), the default
> template is applied automatically, so you can open the PR normally.

By submitting, you confirm your commitment to maintain this extension on behalf
of the CloudNativePG Community.
